## Attenders Classification Reasons

I think that for most of the attenders data we can black-box a classification from the other results. That is, we can just map existing combinations of results onto classifications and run it backwards on any new data we recieve. 

But there's a catch - some respondents were classified in a particular way because of human interention, sometimes because they wrote in the margins (perhaps?) or selected multiple responses. In short, they were bad at surveys.

We want to be consistent with past practise, so it's important to understand how these cases were processed. Gladly, the processors of this data left plentiful notes. This markdown is just a printing of those notes. 

```{r readInData, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
readRDS(here::here("data/generalRdats/attenders2018NoUnderFives.rdat")) ->
  attenders
```

For this exercise, we will only need the `class1`, `class2` and `note` fields.

```{r selectingClassesandNote}
attenders %<>% select(class1, class2, note)
```

We're only interested in attenders with `note` data (shorthand for 'classification notes' in the original data entry interface):

```{r filterOutNoNotes}
attenders %<>% filter(!is.na(note))
```

## View All Notes



```{r seePermutations, results = "asis"}

### Get rid of these:

attenders %<>% 
  filter(note %>% str_to_lower %>% str_detect("^survey monkey response #", negate = TRUE))

attenders %>%
  mutate(note = 
           paste0("- ",note),
         class2 = as.character(class2) %>% 
           {paste0("#### ",.)},
         class1 = as.character(class1) %>% 
           {paste0("### ",.)}) %>% 
  group_by(class1,class2) %>% 
  summarise(note = paste(unique(note), collapse = "\n")) %>% 
  mutate(note = paste0("\n", note, "\n")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  transmute(class1 = class1,
            content = paste0("\n", class2,"\n", note, "\n")) %>% 
  group_by(class1) %>% 
  summarise(content = paste(content, collapse = "", sep = "")) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  transmute(content = paste(class1, "\n", content, "\n")) %>% 
  pull %>% 
  paste(collapse = "") %>% 
  writeLines
```
