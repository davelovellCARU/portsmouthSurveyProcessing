# portsmouthSurveyProcessing
A place for processing the data from the Portsmouth surveys


This repo is **the** place for working on the data from the Portsmouth leader's and attenders surveys. 

Start by knitting 'knitMeFirst.Rmd'. That will knit several other documents which initialise the workspace.

## Data Not Included
Note that the data isn't included here. If you're connected locally to Church Army's shared drive, that shouldn't be a problem.
In fact if you have the data at all, you should be fine: Just knit 'knitMeFirst' - a 'data' folder will appear in the projects root.
Put the .xlsx files in that folder and knit 'knitMeFirst' again.
