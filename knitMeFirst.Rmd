Hello. If you're looking at this from inside RStudio, just hit `Ctrl+Shift+K` to knit the html. 

We are here: `r here()`

## Render Markdowns Until an error is encountered

```{r renderMarkdown1, results = "hide", message=FALSE}
render(here("markdowns/1InitialiseDirectories.Rmd"))
```

```{r renderMarkdowns, collapse = TRUE}
if(readRDS(here("data/progressRdats/1.rdat"))){
  continue = TRUE
  writeLines("1IntitialiseDirectories.Rmd successfully rendered - directory structure created and files in place")
} else {
  writeLines("1InitialiseDirectories.Rmd succesfully rendered, but unable to continue (probably because \"portsmouthLeaders2018\" or \"portsmouthLeaders2019\" are not in the \"data\" directory. See \"markdowns\\1InitialiseDirectories.html\" for details")
}
```
